I'M LEARNING JAVA MYSELF.
I GAIN MOST INFORMATION FROM FREE ONLINE COURSES LIKE JAVASTART.PL, JSYSTEMS.PL OR UDEMY. APART FROM IT I READ A LOT FROM JAVA DOCUMENTATION AND STACK OVERFLOW (AND OCCASIONALLY MANY OTHER SOURCES).
THESE SMALL PROJECTS ARE MY FIRST "BIGGER" STEPS IN PROGRAMMING. I AM DOING MY BEST TO BECOME A BACK-END DEVELOPER IN THE FUTURE.
